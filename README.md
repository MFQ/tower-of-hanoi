# Tower of Hanoi
To simulate and play famouse tower of Hanoi algorithm I have create two applications one represent frontend and other backend. Frontend is an React application and backend is a flask based python application. To get glimpse of its web architecture please review this system diagram.

I have come up with a datastructure that will represent, how many pegs are their in the tower. State of tower will vary as we will try to solve this problem. It is two dimensional array that represent the state of the tower. For example 

```python
towers = [ [1,2,3], [], [] ]
```
Above towers two dimensional array represents first tower has three pegs and other two towers are empty. This screenshort will give you more better understanding.

Now using the powers of this data struture we can save the states of algorithm as it try to solve this problem. To store these moves we will again use another array which will transform our data structure into three dimensional array. For example when we ran this algorithm for three pegs follows moves can be represented by our three dimensional array like this
```python
moves_for_three_pegs = [
  [ [1,2,3], [], [] ],
  [ [2,3], [], [1] ]
  [ [3], [2], [1] ]
  [ [3], [1,2], [] ]
  [ [], [1,2], [3] ]
  [ [1], [2], [3] ]
  [ [1], [], [2,3] ]
  [ [1], [], [1,2,3] ]
]
```


# Frontend Application
Frontend application is consists two modes simulate steps for solving algorithm and other mode is to solve this problem freely. To build flexible Ui I have used konva.js to programmatically create Tow of hanoi Ui. Solution simulator mode relay on backend to generate steps from the Tower of Hannoi algorithm and then render those steps in an Interactive manner. Algorithm solution is generated by an API which expects number of pegs in its payload. In simulator mode there are two buttons which can increase or decrease numbers of pegs. After selecting number of pegs click on solve button which will start simulating solution. In free flow mode user get chance to solve this problem on his own. Peg can be drag and drop into various towers and you can always reset the puzzle. It is an React applicaiton which heavliy relays on hocks, useEffect and functional component. Frontend application can be access from this URL https://tower-of-hanoi-ui-7c6aeeb204e8.herokuapp.com/

# Backend Application
Backend application is consist of one endpoint who accepts **number_of_pegs** from user generates solution for the problem.
